Tiqr LDAP Enrollment Portal
===========================
The Tiqr LDAP Enrollment Portal is a Zend Framework (PHP) application for
Tiqr enrollment of existing LDAP users. 

Setup
=====
To setup the Tiqr Enrollment Portal you have to install this code on a
webserver with PHP 5.3 support with the LDAP module enabled.

Next you have to edit the application's configuration located here:
application/configs/application.ini

Important options to look at:

- resources.tiqr.*
- enrollment.*
- enrollment.ldap.*

The LDAP user you specify should have read and write access for the 
LDAP attributes specified in the configuration. For an LDAP schema
file please checkout the authTiqr SimpleSAML module.

The enrollment portal uses SimpleSAML for login purposes. It is by default
configured to login using an external SimpleSAML setup. To change the
SimpleSAML settings you probably need to edit at least the following files:

- external/simplesamlphp/config/authsources.php
- external/simplesamlphp/metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php

The login is only used to validate if the user can login or not. The 
application doesn't care which user logs in nor does it do any extra
validation of user rights etc.
